Post RSS feed to WordPress blog.

Every feed item is matched against blog category/tag and selected for
posting to blog only if matched, unless specifically told not to
filter. In this case feed item is simply posted to blog, matched or not.

Script stores last update dates for each blog so only new feed items
are posted every time the script is run.

There still a lot to do (like more meaningfull description, naturally)
but is usable in current condition. Check out yaml config file.
