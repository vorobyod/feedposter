TODO:

- Fix dates! Incorrect dates handling causing posts to be 'scheduled'
  instead of published.

- Implement feeds posting per blog

  Best way to do would be with separate config file per blog

- Create related tags table, for instance, matching 'palestine' would
  automatically match 'israel' and 'middle east' categories/tags

- Implement feed types:

* filtered - feed is filtered by tags/categories from blogs;
* unfiltered - every item from feed is posted but tags/categories are still
               supplied, just as in filtered type;

- Impelement per blog switch:

* publish articles but do not post them;
* post articles immediately;
